## Basic REQUIREMENTS for the game

MonoGame requires a .NET Core SDK (3.1 or up) installation.
You can either install it [independently](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core), or by selecting the .NET Core payload when installing Visual Studio 2019 (version 15.4 and up required).

If you are targeting WindowsDX, you are also going to need [the DirectX June 2010 runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) for audio and gamepads to work properly.

When it comes to IDE, Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio Code, and Visual Studio 2019 for Mac are supported (alternatively, you can work directly from the CLI with your code editor of choice).
